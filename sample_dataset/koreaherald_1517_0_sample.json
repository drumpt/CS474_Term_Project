Against this backdrop, a steady inflow of immigrants and foreign residents is a potent factor that could bring about major changes to the fabric of South Korean society, long considered culturally and ethnically homogeneous. Here\u2019s a look at the multiculturalism\u2019s growing hold here, although it may not be visible yet in the mainstream.Migrant workers As of 2016, more than 2 million foreign nationals were residing in South Korea under various visa schemes. The lion\u2019s share, totaling about 549,000, is migrant workers brought in from China and Southeast Asian countries to take up jobs that are shunned by more educated South Korean workers. The majority of these workers are in manufacturing, but there has been a noticeable rise of them in agricultural and fishery sectors which have been struggling with chronic labor shortages. The tally from Statistics Korea, however, leaves out thousands of undocumented foreign laborers living and working here without a valid visa. Foreign wives Since late 1990s, international marriages have risen rapidly to become a major route of immigration into Korea, but in recent years their pace of growth has moderated. In 2008, 11.2 percent of all marriages here involved a non-Korean national but the ratio was down to 7.7 percent in 2016. Over 65 percent of the international unions in 2016 were between a foreign wife and a Korean husband. For the first time that year, Vietnam took over China as the No. 1 country of birth for the foreign wives, with 27.4 percent. China came in second at 26.9 percent, while 4.3 percent of the wives came from the Philippines and 3.9 percent from Japan. In such unions, the average age of first marriage was 36 for the Korean husbands and 27.8 of their wives. Foreign studentsThe number of international students receiving higher education here topped the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2016. Chinese are the overwhelming No. 1 group among them with over 70 percent. Vietnam, Mongolia, Japan and the United States followed although their shares are marginal, less than 5 percent. Rise of new generation\u00a0 (Yonhap)In 2016, 19,431 babies of mixed heritage were born in South Korea, which accounted for 4.8 percent of all births in the country. Rural provinces of Jeolla recorded the highest number of multicultural babies born, followed by the southern island province of Jeju. The Education Ministry data puts the number of multicultural students attending elementary, middle and high school at 109,385 as of August 2017, surpassing the 100,000 mark for the first time. It marked a fivefold increase from 2008, when the number was around 20,000. By Lee Sun-young\u00a0 (milaya@heraldcorp.com)","1":"From North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program nearing completion to the unprecedented impeachment of a president and a major earthquake, the year now drawing to a close has been a difficult one for South Korea.The corruption scandal that broke out in 2016 led to the country\u2019s first impeachment of a president. President Park Geun-hye\u2019s ouster in March in turn led to her and her closest allies being arrested and put on trial on a host of charges. In the wake of Park\u2019s fall from grace, conservatives split into factions, and liberal President Moon Jae-in won the May 9 presidential election. Moon\u2019s election itself sparked off a series of events that hinted at sweeping changes, even if for a limited time, to Korean society.\u00a0 (Yonhap)Moon quickly launched a war against \u201caccumulated ills,\u201d by which the new administration refers to unfair practices and conditions in society. The reform drive has raised allegations of wrongdoings going back to the Lee Myung-bak administration that came to office in 2008. On the economic front, Moon\u2019s reform drive has so far resulted in a large minimum wage hike and higher taxes for the highest earning companies and individuals, both fiercely resisted and criticized by the conservative bloc. The eight months of Moon\u2019s presidency so far have also seen the threat posed by North Korea rise to a new dimension. On Sept. 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, claiming that it had successfully developed a hydrogen bomb. North Korea also conducted a number of intercontinental ballistic missile tests starting in May, the combination of which would imply that Pyongyang has crossed the \u201cred line\u201d Moon drew in his North Korea policies. At the press conference marking his 100th day in office in August, Moon stated that North Korea becoming capable of building ICBMs tipped with nuclear warheads would mean that the \u201cred line\u201d has been crossed. The year also saw South Korea experience friction with its two largest trading partners -- China and the US.The trouble with China began in 2016, following the Park administration\u2019s decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system. The decision to deploy THAAD prompted economic retaliation by China, dealing massive blows to South Korean companies and the tourism industry. Although Seoul-Beijing relations have thawed from the height of tensions, the two sides have yet to narrow their differences on THAAD, which Beijing considers a threat to its national security. Although on a much lesser scale, Seoul\u2019s trade relations with the US also hit a rut over the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, which US President Donald Trump termed a \u201chorrible deal.\u201d Despite Seoul\u2019s attempts to avoid a renegotiation, the Trump administration pressed the issue on numerous occasions, and the two sides are currently renegotiating the deal. The year also saw major domestic issues unfold. In March, the ferry Sewol was raised from the seabed, nearly three years after it sank off the country\u2019s west coast, leaving 304 people dead or missing. Although the vessel was raised, five passengers remain unaccounted for. A 5.4 magnitude earthquake shook the port city of Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on Nov. 15. Among its many consequences, the quake led to the postponement of the annual university entrance exam for the first time in history.

The panel said 25.4 percent opposed Ahn.\u00a0 Ahn Cheol-soo at a press conference Sunday following the People's Party vote results (Yonhap)Ahn on Dec. 20 proposed the vote on the merger aimed at beefing up the centrist forces ahead of local elections slated for next June. Ahn had pledged to resign if he lost the vote.\u00a0After the announcement, the former presidential candidate vowed to push for the merger swiftly.\u00a0\"I received overwhelming support from the members of the People's Party,\" Ahn said in a news conference.\u00a0\"I will accept the party members' will expressed in the vote as their aspiration for change. I will look no other way and will move forward on the path of integration,\" he said.Ahn's rivals in the party called the vote invalid, citing low turnout. They said Ahn failed to win the vote and should step down as he promised.\"This is a clear indication of a vote of nonconfidence for Ahn,\" a group of 18 lawmakers said in a press conference. They launched their own group to oust Ahn and block what they called a conservative collusion.\u00a0The dissenters are largely based in the southwestern region, which has been traditionally opposed to rightist politicians. A merger with the conservative Bareun Party would dent their prospects in future elections, including the June gubernatorial and mayoral elections.\u00a0\u00a0The lower turnout is far below the quorum of a third of members required by the party constitution to determine crucial issues, such as a merger with other parties.\u00a0The poll led by Ahn's faction was not directly about the merger plan but questioned whether or not the respondents support Ahn who pushes for the merger.Ahn's side pointed out that the voter ratio was close to the 24.26 percent turnout of the last party election in August, in which Ahn was picked chairman.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the day, a man barged into the party's headquarters and attacked Rep. Lee Dong-seop, chief of the election committee, when he was announcing the vote result. The man kicked the podium with his leg and got into a tussle with party officials. He was taken into police custody later.\u00a0\u00a0The integration of the two parties has been seen as a strategy to combine the centrist political force to counterbalance the two major parties -- the ruling Democratic Party with 121 seats and the main opposition Liberty Korea Party with 116 seats in the 299-member National Assembly.The People's Party holds 39 seats, while the Bareun Party has11 lawmakers.

(AFP-Yonhap)The Lighthouse Winmore has 25 crew members including 23 mainland Chinese citizens and two Myanmar nationals, another customs official at Yeosu said. The tanker, chartered by Taiwanese company Billions Bunker Group Corp., previously visited Yeosu on October 11 and loaded up on some 14,000 tonnes of Japanese refined oil before heading towards its purported destination in Taiwan.Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred 600 tonnes of oil to the North's Sam Jong 2 in international waters off China before returning to Yeosu, the customs service officials said.Earlier a foreign ministry official in Seoul had said the ship had been seized briefly by customs authorities who inspected it.Results of the investigation will be reported to the UN Security Council's sanctions committee, foreign ministry officials said.The Lighthouse Winmore is one of 10 ships the US has asked the Security Council to blacklist for violating sanctions against North Korea. Taipei said the Billions Bunker Group is not incorporated in Taiwan but in the Marshall Islands, and that it would \"continue to fully comply\" with UN sanctions against North Korea.Taiwan's transport ministry said it is investigating whether any Taiwanese entities were involved.The ship is owned by a Hong Kong-registered company called Win More Shipping Limited. There was nobody Friday at the address given for the firm on Hong Kong's companies registry.Four ships -- three North Korean vessels and a Palau-flagged oil tanker -- were blocked from international ports by the UN Security Council on Thursday over suspicions of carrying or transporting goods banned by sanctions targeting Pyongyang's weapons ambitions, according to the final list adopted by the world body.Even though the Sam Jong 2 was not among the four banned vessels, it appears on a list of six other ships suspected of transporting illicit cargo, along with the Lighthouse Winmore.The US had asked the Security Council to blacklist all 10 vessels, but China objected to the proposal, diplomats said, and only agreed to blacklist four ships on Thursday.The Security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on North Korea this year: one on August 5 targeting the iron, coal and fishing industries, another set on September 11 aimed at textiles and limiting oil supply, and the most recent on December 22 focused on refined petroleum products.Pyongyang has slammed the latest sanctions as an \"act of war\" and on Saturday, the state-run KCNA news agency said in a commentary that the country would continue to pursue its nuclear ambitions.\"The DPRK, an undeniable new strategic state and nuclear power...declares: Do not expect any change in its policy\", it said, referring to the North by the abbreviation of its official name.\"Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out.\" (AFP)","5":"South Korea has confirmed a fresh case of avian influenza at a duck farm in the southwestern region, the agriculture ministry said Saturday, raising alarms in the major poultry production region already infected with highly pathogenic bird flu.The H5N6-strain bird flu was detected on a farm with 35,000 ducks in Yeongam, 380 kilometers south of Seoul, while quarantine officials were conducting an inspection in the county, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said.\u00a0 (Yonhap)It was located within 3 kilometers of another farm that reported the outbreak of a highly pathogenic AI on Dec. 19, which was put under restriction of movement of poultry, livestock breeders and equipment.An in-depth analysis into the virus has been under way to figure out whether it is highly pathogenic and the inspection result will be released in a couple of days, the ministry said. Highly pathogenic AI refers to viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates.South Korea has been stepping up quarantine measures in the southwestern region, including culling of over 200,000 birds, to prevent further spread of the highly contagious virus.Last year, South Korea slaughtered more than 30 million birds to contain the worst outbreak of bird flu in the country's history.

His strategy, known as \"byungjin,\" aims to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea's nuclear weapons program.North Korea's repeated underground nuclear tests and launches of long-range missiles that could conceivably reach the U.S. mainland have brought more sanctions down on the North than ever before. But outside experts believe the country \u2014 while still struggling in many areas \u2014 is showing signs of modest economic growth and improved agricultural production. It could be just a year or two away from having an operational, nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.Applied science, according to the North's policymakers, is absolutely essential on all fronts.Kim has transformed the Pyongyang skyline with high-rise apartments to house his prized rocket scientists and nuclear engineers, and Paek repeatedly stressed while giving a tour of the facility to The Associated Press how even an ancient delicacy like kimchi can benefit from scientific innovation.Paek, who accompanied Kim on his \"on-the-spot guidance\" visits, said the factory has 150 workers but is for the most part automated.She said the primary objective of the factory is to operate in a \"scientific manner at every stage.\" In kimchi-making, that means inspections all along the production line to ensure quality and hygiene. The factory boasts of a one-of-a-kind \"kimchi analyzer\" to maintain the proper levels of saltiness and lactic acid \u2014 its signature ingredient.\u00a0In this Dec. 20, 2017, photo, manager Paek Mi Hye holds a package of kimchi produced at the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory on the outskirts of Pyongyang, North Korea.

Until 2013, the number of North Koreans seeking asylum in Europe had been on the rise, peaking in 2013 with 400 North Koreans requesting asylum in Europe. The figure dropped to 140 in 2014. In 2015, there were 130 North Koreans who applied to move to a European country. By country, 30 defectors sought refuge in Germany while France and Britain received 20 requests each. Sweden, Luxembourg and Bulgaria also separately received five such requests. Experts view the decreasing trend being partly due to the lower number of those defecting from the North.

In a reversal of tradition, business tycoons, political bigwigs and close associates of the president were excluded from the presidential pardons executed for the first time since President Moon Jae-in came to power in May. Justice Minister Park Sang-ki (Yonhap)\u201cThis amnesty is aimed at relieving the burden of ordinary citizens facing difficulties due to criminal punishment or administrative restrictions, and offering them chances to return to a normal social life early,\u201d said Justice Minister Park Sang-ki at a press briefing held at Seoul Government Complex. As of Saturday, 6,444 people -- mostly minor criminal offenders who violated traffic laws and committed petty crimes while trying to make a living -- will be pardoned. Administrative restrictions -- such as the cancellation of a driver\u2019s license -- which were placed on 1.6 million people will be lifted.Among the pardoned are 25 people who had been convicted for their roles in a violent clash in Yongsan, central Seoul in 2009. They were staging a sit-in against the government\u2019s decision to forcibly evict them as part of its urban renewal plan. A fire broke out when the police were confronting them, which resulted in the death of five protestors and one police officer. \u201cTo heal social conflicts and unite the Korean people, the government pardoned evictees in the Yongsan incident -- an iconic public safety-related case done with an investigation and trial,\u201d Minister Park said. Chung Bong-ju is the only political criminal to be pardoned. He served one year in prison for violation of election law after raising allegations over then-conservative frontrunner Lee Myung-bak\u2019s involvement in stock price rigging ahead of the 2007 presidential race. The pardon reinstated his right to run for elected office until 2022. Also, 24 migrant workers, the elderly aged over 70, those suffering from serious illness and two inmates who gave birth in prison received clemency. The government kept business tycoons and bureaucrats accused of corruption, as well as those who committed felonies such as rape and murder off the list, which it said was an effort to uphold the rule of law. Under the last four administrations, scores of executives of powerful family-run conglomerates, including Samsung, Hyunai Motor and SK, were granted amnesty after a conviction of mostly corporate crimes in return for their promises to spur the nation\u2019s economic growth and create jobs. On the campaign trail, President Moon vowed not to pardon those involved in corruption and economic crimes, which appears to come in line with his key principles in governing state affairs -- rooting \u201caccumulated ills\u201d in society and achieving an \u201ceconomic democratization.\u201d Some controversial figures who might provoke a political divide were excluded. Han Sang-gyun, a chief of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions who was convicted of leading illegal rallies, was not pardoned. Han is serving a three-year prison term for leading anti-government rallies in protest against ousted President Park Geun-hye\u2019s labor policies in 2015. Lee Seok-gi, a former lawmaker of the now-disbanded Unified Progressive Party, was also not given amnesty.

Instead of going to Taiwan, however, the vessel transferred the oil to a North Korean ship, the Sam Jong 2, and three other non-North Korean vessels in international waters in the East China Sea, they said. \"The actions taken will be reported to the UNSC sanctions committee on North Korea in the future,\" according to the authorities. \"This marks a typical case of North Korea shrewdly circumventing UNSC sanctions by using its illegal networks.\" The officials said South Korea has shared intelligence with the US for the detection of the illegal transaction.In their search of the seized vessel, South Korean authorities secured navigation logs and testimony from the crew that the oil transaction was ordered by the Taiwanese group through the vessel's caption. But motive of the transaction with North Korea is not known, the officials noted. South Korea will be keeping the Hong Kong-flagged vessel for about six months, during which time Hong Kong is expected to file a request for the ship's release with the UNSC's sanctions committee on North Korea. The US has reportedly called on the UNSC to blacklist 10 ships for engaging in proscribed trade with North Korea although China and Russia are opposed to that. Lighthouse Winmore was reportedly one of the 10 targeted ships. The Security Council sanctions committee will make a decision on the request on Friday (New York time), according to the officials.

Kaesong Industrial Complex (Yonhap)Lee Eugene, vice spokesperson at the Unification Ministry handling inter-Korean affairs, said in a briefing that the ministry had no plan to request an investigation.Shin Han-yong, head of the task force, asked the government to make every effort to resume the Kaesong Industrial Complex.\"We would like go to Kaesong,\" Shin and 10 other businessmen chanted in a news conference in western Seoul as they held a yellow placard that read, \"Immediately resume operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.\"South Korea has said the resumption of the factory park would hinge on progress in the resolution of the North Korean nuclear and missile programs.The call for the resumption came as the international community has stepped up sanctions to cut off sources of hard currency for Pyongyang. UN sanctions ban transfers of bulk cash to Pyongyang.In Washington, the State Department said the US supports the 2016 decision to shut down the Kaesong Complex in the face of North Korea's destabilizing and provocative actions, according to Voice of America.\"The decision reflects growing concern in the region about North Korea's growing threat and flagrant disregard of multiple UN Security Council resolutions,\" VOA quoted a State Department spokesman as saying.In 2016, South Korea said the shutdown of the factory park was meant to keep money generated by the industrial park from going to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development.The panel, set up to review the previous conservative governments' North Korea policies, said Thursday that there is not sufficient information or evidence to support the claim that funds from the complex had been used to build weapons.Han also asked the government to compensate the companies that have factories in Kaesong for the losses they suffered and provide assistance to help normalize their business operations.The South Korean firms claimed that the closure has incurred about 1.5 trillion won ($1.4 billion) in losses, but the government estimated their losses to be 786 billion won.South Korea has decided to offer an additional 66 billion won in funds to the companies that invested in the factory park in addition to the previous government assistance of 517.3 billion won.The industrial enclave -- opened in 2004 -- had been hailed as a key symbol of economic cooperation between the rival Koreas as it combined South Korean capital and technology with cheap labor from North Korea.

Kim conducted 93 inspections between Jan. 1 and Dec. 28, which marked the least number of public appearances since he rose to power in 2011, according to an analysis of reports by Yonhap News Agency and Unification Ministry data here. Last year, the number was tallied at 133.Military-related tours made up the largest portion at 44 percent, in line with Kim\u2019s recurring appearances in photos that depicted the North\u2019s nuclear and missile development program throughout the year. The figure is also a record-high for military inspections by Kim since 2011. This year alone, North Korea test-launched a total of three intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September. The latest ICBM experiment in September signaled an advancement in its nuclear weapons program, with experts saying that it could reach the US mainland if launched on a standard trajectory. Japan\u2019s Nihon Keizai said Thursday that Kim\u2019s less frequent public appearances may be due to nervousness over a possible \u201cdecapitation plan\u201d to take out the North\u2019s leadership by the South Korea-US joint forces. It added that Kim Jong-un has been moving around dawn to avoid being detected by the US reconnaissance satellite and has been using one of his aide\u2019s vehicles rather than his own. Nihon Keizai\u2019s report echoes the South Korean spy agency\u2019s claims in June that the young dictator prefers to operate at dawn and uses his subordinates\u2019 cars, such as a Lexus car, instead of his own Mercedes-Benz 600. Kim has been collecting information about the \u201cclandestine operation\u201d through his own intelligence agency, the South\u2019s National Intelligence Service said at a closed-door parliamentary session, according to Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, who attended the meeting.Earlier this month, Seoul allocated some 340 million won ($310,000) for a South Korean \u201cdecapitation unit\u201d tasked with eliminating North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un, the Defense Ministry here said. But the NIS also saw the drop in public appearances as a sign of Kim\u2019s stabilization of power within the North Korean government. North Korea\u2019s ruling party also reportedly underwent a large-scale personnel reshuffle earlier this year in a bid to strengthen the regime\u2019s sovereignty. Experts saw it as a move to cement Kim\u2019s place in the government. Hwang Pyong-so, a top military official viewed as the North\u2019s second most powerful figure, mysteriously disappeared in October, and the NIS told lawmakers here the he had been punished for having an \u201cimpure attitude\u201d toward Kim. Lee said that the Unification Ministry has yet to find evidence that backs foreign news reports suggesting Hwang\u2019s execution. Meanwhile, Kim\u2019s appearances related to the economy made up about 27 percent of all his public appearances, the analysis showed. Overall, Kim has been faithfully carrying out his plan to seek nuclear armament and economic growth for the prosperity of North Korea, also known as the \u201cbyongjin policy,\u201d in 2017.

Former lawmaker Chung Bong-ju (Yonhap)The list came as somewhat a surprise as many had hoped, if not expected, the list to include those close to President Moon Jae-in, such as Lee Kwang-jae, a former lawmaker and governor of Gangwon Province who also worked as a presidential secretary under the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, along with Moon.The Cheong Wa Dae official said Lee would not have made it onto the list as the president has pledged to exclude anyone convicted of corruption from receiving a special pardon.Lee was convicted in 2011 of receiving illegal political funds in 2009.\"This time, the government excluded those convicted of election law violations as a basic principle,\" the Cheong Wa Dae official said.The list included Chung Bong-ju, a former lawmaker convicted of election law violations for raising false corruption allegations against former President Lee Myung-bak ahead of the 2007 presidential election.The Cheong Wa Dae official explained Chung was the only politician left not reinstated from convictions from the 2007 election, while all else have been pardoned and thus reinstated through two special pardons under the former Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.

The report comes amid the UN implementation of a punitive action on the North to place ceilings on coal purchases from it for its missile and nuclear provocations.Obtained through the satellite-imaging and data company Planet, the satellite imagery of the three North Korean western ports -- Nampho, Daean and Songlim -- shows that over the past year heaps of coal at the ports have been running out, while there have been few\u00a0 vessels leaving and arriving at the ports, the broadcaster said. (Yonhap)At the port of Nampho, the report said, three vessels had been spotted leaving after being moored, with the port full of coal last year. But the number of vessels moored at the port has fallen sharply since March. \"There were no vessels seen in the March satellite imagery, and the time of the port being empty was longer than ever in the April-November period,\" VOA said.An analysis of satellite imagery involving the ports of Daean and Songlim, from which North Korean coal is exported to China, shows heaps of coals there have almost bottomed out.VOA said the change is believed to have been made since Nov. 30, 2016, when the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2321 in the wake of the North's fifth nuclear test in September. The resolution placed ceilings on coal purchases from the North, a move aimed at making it harder for Pyongyang to earn money that could be exploited to advance its weapons capabilities.The port of Najin on North Korea's northeastern coast near its border with Russia, however, had briskly shipped coal until October this year. In November, heaps of coal at the port began to bottom out and satellite imagery taken on Dec. 6 shows there only remains a small amount of coal, it said.The UN resolution makes it an exception for Russian coal to be exported through Najin port.

The violent clash on the rooftop of a building left two protesters and one police officer dead and dozens of others injured.Former legislator Chung Bong-ju was the only politician included in the first special pardons under President Moon Jae-in. Justice Minister Park Sang-ki (Yonhap)Chung was convicted for raising allegations ahead of the 2007 presidential election that then leading candidate Lee was the real owner of an investment consulting firm, known as BBK, accused of stock price rigging. That earned Chung the nickname \"MB sniper.\" The conviction had stripped Chung of his right to run for elected office until 2022, but Friday's pardon reinstated his right.Ahead of Friday's pardons, calls had risen among liberals for pardoning Han Sang-kyun, a former leader of the militant umbrella labor organization Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, as well as Lee Seok-ki, a former lawmaker of a now-defunct progressive party convicted of treason charges.But the government didn't include them in the amnesty. Their pardons would have sparked strong protests from conservative opposition parties.Also excluded from the pardons were top business tycoons.Most of the beneficiaries were ordinary people. As part of the amnesty, the government also pardoned about 1.65 million traffic violators who had their driver's licenses revoked or suspended for earned demerit points.

It conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September and launched intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) three times, most recently in late November.In July and August, Kim engaged in no economy-related public events, as the North apparently focused on missile testing.This year, Kim concentrated on advancing nuclear and missile programs, one pillar of his signature policy of developing nukes in tandem with the economy, commonly known as the \"byongjin\" policy.Jo Yong-won, a vice director of the ruling party's central committee, accompanied Kim the most this year as 34 cases were recorded in North Korea's media reports.Top military official Hwang Pyong-so used to rank first as an entourage member until October, but his name could not be found in the North's media since then as he was punished after the party's probe into a key military organ.Lee said that she has no information to confirm a foreign report that Hwang may have been executed.

The two minor opposition parties have long struggled to gain a foothold at the National Assembly, as two major parties dominate the legislative process. As a way of reaching a breakthrough, the leaders of the center-left People\u2018s Party and center-right Bareun Party have proposed a merger, and while opinions are divided, the result of the all-member ballot of the People\u2019s Party -- which is to come out Sunday -- is likely to decide the fate of the two parties.There are mainly five political parties at the Korean National Assembly. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea, main opposition Liberty Korea Party and center-left People\u2019s party hold negotiation bloc status, while minor center-right Bareun Party and far-left Justice Party only have parliamentary seats. (Yonhap)Korean politics has long been dominated by two major political parties, with other smaller parties mere struggling for negotiating group status. Last year, however, a third party emerged to challenge the traditional two-party system. The People\u2019s Party was the surprise of the 2016 general election, winning 38 parliamentary seats in the 300-member parliament, only two months after its founding in February. Promoting centrist politics, the minor party which now has 39 lawmakers has become the swing vote at the National Assembly.Another unexpected event occurred in the wake of a massive corruption scandal last year that led to the ouster of President Park Geun-hye. More than 30 lawmakers from the conservative then-ruling Saenuri Party -- now rebranded as the Liberty Korea Party -- bolted in January to form the minor splinter Bareun Party. The establishment of the two new minor opposition parties resulted in four negotiating bodies in the parliament at the time, and made the presidential election in May a five-way race. While the emergence of minor parties raised the possibility of a multiparty system here, the political environment continues to threaten their survival.The People\u2019s Party has so far failed to make clear its centrist identity and is currently suffering from intensifying internal feuds. Bareun Party lost its negotiating bloc status after many of its legislators returned to the Liberty Korea Party, leaving it with only 11 lawmakers.Pundits say the parties\u2019 survival now depends on the upcoming local election slated for June, and if they do not garner significant victories, they may suffer similar fates to previous minor parties, dissolving back to a two-party system.Viability of multiparty system in KoreaIs a multiparty system impossible in Korean politics?Since the last constitutional revision in 1987 -- when direct presidential elections were introduced -- politics has been a battleground between the governing party and one main opposition party. Conservatives and liberals took turns in controlling the government and other smaller parties rarely achieved negotiation bloc status. \u201cElections were always a two-way race between candidates from the two biggest parties,\u201d professor Park Sang-byoung of Inha University told The Korea Herald. \u201cAnd in the past, the voters saw that their competition was not a competition of policies, but that it was mere politicking to win elections.\u201dFor the five parties currently in the parliament -- the left-wing Justice Party also holds six seats -- Park said that voters\u2019 aversion to the \u201cindolent\u201d and \u201cunproductive\u201d politics has exploded, leading to the dispersion of votes. It cannot be denied that a multiparty system would be to the benefit of a democratic society as more parties would mean more chances for diverse interests to be represented. But experts say the current election system and history of Korea have created a landscape not so favorable for a stable multiparty system.Park explained that the binary nature of Korean politics is rooted in the country\u2018s history.\u201cThe country witnessed, on many occasions, how crucial it is to unite against enemies. The people had to gather power against the imperialistic Japan and the communist North,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was \u2018us\u2019 against \u2018them,\u2019 and such a history has led to the dichotomous single-member district and the presidential systems.\u201dSohn Ho-cheol, a political science professor at Sogang University, echoed the view.\u201cThe idea that strength is in numbers is widespread, as voters have experienced the binary structure of politics for so long -- the fear of losing if they do not gather forces,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a transition period. The desire for new politics with more parties to represent interests and the desire to return to old politics exist at the same time.\u201d Deep-rooted regionalism has also contributed to creating binary politics.Broadly speaking, the most pronounced regional cleavage exists between the Gyeongsang provinces in the southeast and Jeolla provinces in the southwest, with the former a stronghold of conservatives and the latter of liberals. Politicians have used the regional divide as leverage to maintain footholds at the National Assembly, electioneering in favorable regions with an eye to securing stable victories. \u201cThe voters are not blind. It was just that they chose from the two choices they were given. If there are more choices, they would take other choices,\u201d Chung Youn-chung, a Pai Chai University professor, said. Recent national elections, including last year\u2019s general election and the presidential election in May, show a change in voting trends. The biggest hurdle pointed out by the minor parties is the single-member electorate system in which voters pick one leader for a single district. \u201cThe current system is a winner-takes-all system which basically ignores all the rest of the votes. For example, if a politician wins with 41 percent of the votes, 59 percent of ballot papers go to the bin,\u201d Chung explained. The presidential system, along with the single-member district system, also makes it harder than in a cabinet government for minor parties to establish a strong foothold at the parliament, said Kim Wook, also a professor at Pai Chai University and who also heads the Korean Elections Society.The most urgent task in fostering a sustainable multiparty system is to change the electorate system, according to experts. They were unanimous in calling for the introduction of larger electoral constituencies with more than one representative, or a party-list proportional representation system to allow more parties to have a voice. It is an argument also being made by People\u2019s Party Chairman Ahn Cheol-soo.As to changing the voting culture influenced by regionalism, school education can help. In Germany, which has come to be viewed as a beacon of a stable multiparty system, straw votes for teens are operated alongside national elections, and students are taught to cast votes for candidates that advocate their interests. It is also crucial for small parties to show themselves as viable policymakers. The new parties, then, would not have to present unique ideological positions to gain traction, Kim said. \u201cIn Korea, it is just simple \u2018liberals versus conservatives.\u2019 But under a working multiparty system, the ideological and political backgrounds of a political party vary from one end of the spectrum to the other.\u201dChung, on the other hand, explained that it is crucial for the People\u2019s Party to uphold its centrist politics and differentiate itself from the two major parties.But for any party to win votes, it must compete fair and square with policies, Chung said.\u201cAs for the People\u2019s Party, it boasts its role as a casting voter at the National Assembly, but they are just taking sides on each different agenda item. They do not have their own policies to fight on,\u201d she said. \u201cFor any party to survive under the multiparty system, it should give clear policy choices for voters to choose from.\u201dBy Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)","35":"The closure of the inter-Korean Kaesong industrial park last year was a unilateral decision made by former President Park Geun-hye, a civilian panel tasked with reviewing unification policies said Thursday. The panel also said that unification policies should be codified, and that the Ministry of Unification should be given more independence and its views given more weight in setting related policies.\u00a0 The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea viewed from Paju, Gyeonggi Province on Thursday. Yonhap\u201cContrary to the former administration\u2019s announcement, it has been confirmed that (former) President Park Geun-hye ordered (South Korean entities) to withdraw from the Kaesong complex on Feb. 8, before the National Security Council meeting on Feb. 10,\u201d the panel said. According to the panel, Park\u2019s Foreign Policy Secretary Kim Kyu-hyun informed then-Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo of Park\u2019s decision to shut the complex down on Feb. 8. The NSC, led by former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin at the time, convened later in the day. Related plans were drawn up and announced on Feb. 10. The Park administration had said that the decision was made by the NSC on Feb. 10. The complex was shut down in response to North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test and long-range missile launch conducted on Jan. 6 and Feb. 7, respectively. The panel, however, said that it was unable to verify how Park came to make the decision or if she discussed the issue with others. It has been alleged that Choi Soon-sil, who is accused of meddling in state affairs, was involved in the decision. The panel\u2019s report also said that the Park administration\u2019s claim that North Korea was using Kaesong employees\u2019 wages for the development of nuclear weapons lacked evidence. \u201c(The claim) lacked solid information or sufficient grounds, and was inserted by Cheong Wa Dae without consulting the concerned organizations,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe documents referenced at the time were based on circumstantial evidence, and based on defectors\u2019 testimonies, and therefore lacked credibility and objectivity.\u201dThe panel also raised issues with the execution of the measure, saying that the closing of the complex did not follow legal procedures and that the government neglected to protect South Korean investors\u2019 assets. \u201cLegal basis for compensating losses sustained by businesses (involved in inter-Korean) economic cooperation projects should be established, and an insurance system for economic cooperation and trade should be improved,\u201d the panel said. The panel also said that the government needs to prepare for the reopening of the complex if conditions are met, and called for prohibiting the government from using North Korea-related information for political ends. \u201cNorth Korea intelligence being used politically must be prohibited,\u201d the panel said, citing information regarding the defections of Thae Young-ho and a group of North Korean restaurant employees. Thae is a former North Korean diplomat who defected to the South in August. He is the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to have fled the regime. The mass defection by North Korean restaurant employees took place in April, and the information was revealed four days ahead of the April 13 general election last year. At the time, 13 North Koreans working at a Beijing restaurant operated by the North Korean government fled to the South.

The First Fleet is based in the East Sea.The exercise is conducted twice a year and involves the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force and police. Navy destroyers, fighter jets and patrol aircraft are participating in the drill, the Navy said. The exercise immediately drew an angry reaction from Japan, just as past exercises have done. Japan has long claimed the islets, which lie closer to South Korea than Japan, a fact that causes diplomatic tension with South Korea. (Yonhap)The Tokyo filed a protest with Seoul, saying the exercise is \"unacceptable,\" Japan's Kyodo News reported, quoting a senior official.The exercise started one day after a South Korean government panel concluded that the agreement with Japan that settled a wartime sex slavery dispute two years ago was defective. A military official dismissed any political implication of the exercise's timing, saying it had been set up a month earlier.

The task force also concluded that the 2015 deal failed to resolve the issue and did not reflect the public sentiment.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, however, criticized the incumbent administration, claiming it has needlessly revealed all the details of the 2015 deal as an act of \u201cpolitical vendetta.\u201d The party was formerly the ruling Saenuri Party under the Park administration, but rebranded itself after Park was removed from office over a massive corruption scandal.\u00a0 Floor leader Woo Won-shik of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea speaks at a party meeting at the National Assembly on Thursday. YonhapMeanwhile the ruling Democratic Party of Korea Floor Leader Woo won-shik told a party meeting, \u201cWe now know that the Park Geun-hye administration made a secret agreement and the whole process was a diplomatic disaster. We cannot hide our fury.\u201d \u201cWe will discuss a solution taking a victim-centered approach. We would also like to ask the Japanese government to review their stance, instead of repeating that there was nothing wrong in the process of reaching the deal.\u201dRep. Woo also demanded an apology by Liberty Party Korea for praising the bilateral deal as a \u201chistorical feat which no past government has made,\u201d at the time. Center-left People\u2019s Party also criticized the former government for making a \u201cshameful deal.\u201d\u201cIt turns out that the Park administration kept all the sensitive parts of the agreement that goes against South Korea in the dark and met Japan\u2019s demands,\u201d the party\u2019s chief policymaker Rep. Lee Yong-ho said. \u201cJapan tried to cover up its criminal history with only 1 billion yen ($8.84 million).\u201dIt also called for a strong measure from the government, saying the majority of citizens want an abolishment of the agreement. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, on the other hand, went on the offensive against the government, charging that it has not only shown a humiliating diplomatic performance, but is also using all issues for political retaliation against the former government. \u201cThis amateur government is not only exhausting the country inside, but is making a big mistake outside,\u201d Floor Leader Kim Sung-tae said at a party meeting. On Wednesday, the party spokesman Rep. Chang Je-won said the task force report was a poor diplomatic decision. \u201cAmid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a strong alliance with the United States and Japan is crucial to protect the country from the nuclear threats from North Korea. The revelation is a poor move that is far removed from resolving the comfort women issue, and can lead to serious security issues,\u201d he said in a press release on Wednesday. He also said the government should have made clear its position and solutions to the problem first, rather than having the task force reveal unnecessary details.

(Yonhap)","41":"President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that the long-simmering issue of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women can't be resolved by a bilateral 2015 accord, calling it a \"political\" deal with no consensus from victims and citizens.Moon made the remarks a day after the foreign ministry task force announced the outcome of its five-month review of the deal, finding that the former Park Geun-hye administration kept part of the accord secret apparently to avoid criticism of its concessions to Tokyo.\"It has been confirmed that the negotiations on the comfort women issue between South Korea and Japan in 2015 had significant defects in terms of procedures and content. ... It is regrettable but something that we can't circumvent,\" he said in a statement.Comfort woman is a euphemistic term that refers to women who were forced by Japan to serve in frontline military brothels during World War II.\"This runs afoul of the established universal principle of the international community for settling historical issues, and above all, it was a political agreement that excludes victims themselves and citizens,\" he added.The president went on to say, \"Along with citizens, I, as president, make it clear again that the comfort women issue can't be settled through the deal.\" This photo, taken on Oct. 24, 2017, shows President Moon Jae-in speaking during a Cabinet meeting at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul. (Yonhap)Moon then stressed what matters most in historical issues is \"truth,\" but signaled his desire to separate historical feuds from ongoing efforts to foster a future-oriented partnership with Tokyo, Seoul's crucial partner in deterring Pyongyang's nuclear threats.\"We need the courage to face our painful past. ... Even if it is a painful past that we want to avoid, we have to squarely face it,\" he said.\"Separately from the settlement of the historical issue, I will try, at the same time, to restore normal diplomatic relations for future-oriented cooperation between South Korea and Japan,\" he added.Moon stopped short of clarifying whether his government would push for scrapping or renegotiating the deal, neither of which options Tokyo is likely to accept.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae remained ambivalent, saying later that \"for now,\" it could not answer the question of whether the deal was effectively scrapped.\"The government will determine its position after sufficiently listening to opinions and views from former comfort women and other organizations (supporting them),\" a presidential official told reporters, declining to be named.South Korea and Japan announced the deal on Dec. 28, 2015, under which they agreed to \"finally and irreversibly\" resolve the comfort women issue, while Tokyo apologized for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen (US$8.9 million) to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.The deal, however, prompted strong criticism from victims and civic groups who claim that Japan's apology was not sincere enough and that the government did not consult with them in advance. Some call for renegotiating or even scrapping the deal.

(Yonhap)","42":"Ousted former President Park Geun-hye unilaterally ordered the shutdown of an inter-Korean industrial complex last year without proper consultations and legitimate process, a panel report showed Thursday.The report was unveiled by a nine-member committee of civilian experts that has been reviewing the previous conservative governments' North Korea policies, including Seoul's closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex in February 2016. The panel was launched by Seoul's unification ministry in September.The Park administration shut down the factory zone, just north of the inter-Korean border, in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in 2016. The move put an end to the last symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation.\"It is verified that the closure was decided by the president's unilateral verbal order without discussions and consultations at the official decision-making level,\" the report showed.The former government said that the shutdown was decided at a National Security Council meeting on Feb. 10, 2016, right before the announcement. But the report showed that Park made the order two days earlier.It also said that the closure is a decision that transcends law, adding that even a political decision amid a security crisis should be made within the boundary of law and under legal procedures.At that time, the ministry said that the decision was aimed at preventing money generated by the factory park from bankrolling North Korea's nuclear and missile development. This file photo shows the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the now-shuttered inter-Korean industrial park, just north of the border. (Yonhap)But the panel said that there is no sufficient information or evidence to support the claim that funds from the complex had been used for other purposes.\"This hampers the legitimacy of the government's decision and limits Seoul's future stance over the resumption of the Kaesong complex,\" the report showed.The report failed to clear up speculation that Choi Soon-sil, the now-jailed long-time friend of Park, might have been behind the closure. The former government dismissed the allegations.Choi was at the center of the corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment in December 2016 and ouster earlier this year.The report is likely to rekindle a row over under what conditions the operation of the Kaesong complex can be resumed.The liberal Moon Jae-in government is seeking better inter-Korean ties and engagement with Pyongyang though it now focuses on employing sanctions and pressure on the North over its nuclear programs.Seoul said the resumption of the industrial park would hinge on progress in the resolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile problems.\"With implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions on the North, we need to re-open the Kaesong park and to actively prepare for it if certain conditions are met due to changes in the global political landscape,\" the report added.The committee, meanwhile, added that intelligence on North Korea should not be politically used, saying that the government broke the practice of not revealing details about defections by North Koreans.Last year, the ministry announced that 12 North Korean female workers at a Chinese restaurant en masse and Thae Yong-ho, a former diplomat stationed in the North's embassy in Britain, defected to the South.\"The ministry passively made the announcement at the request of Seoul's spy agency. It is identified that the ministry was not even aware of details about intelligence well,\" Im Seong-taek, a lawyer and panel member, told a briefing.The panel also stressed that the issue of humanitarian assistance should be separately handled from political considerations and civilian inter-Korean exchanges need to be encouraged.A joint tour program at Mount Kumgang in North Korea has been suspended since 2008, when a South Korean tourist was killed by a North Korean soldier there. Seoul also imposed sanctions banning inter-Korean exchanges in May 2010 to punish North Korea's sinking of a South Korean warship.The panel's review came as the Moon government is seeking to set a North Korea policy that can survive through succeeding administrations regardless of their ideology. It said that South Korea's inter-Korean policy should be made based on public consensus and law and in a consistent manner.The ministry said it will take into account the panel's policy recommendations in setting its policy on North Korea and unification.

(Yonhap)They also urged the Moon Jae-in administration to dissolve the state-run Reconciliation and Healing Foundation, which was established to support the victims as a result of the deal, and return the funds totaling 1 billion yen offered by Japanese government. \u201cIn any of the process and the result of the 2015 deal, there were no concerns for the victims and there were no efforts made by the Korean government to reflect victims\u2019 positions,\u201d the groups said at a press briefing in front of the Foreign Ministry building in Seoul.\u201cThe Moon Jae-in government must immediately accept the result of the task force\u2019s probe and victims\u2019 demands and must not delay the nullification of the 2015 agreement,\u201d they said, criticizing the Moon administration for \u201cremaining silent\u201d on the issue. Announcing the result of its five-month investigation into the much-disputed deal earlier in the day, the Foreign Ministry task force said that the Park administration hid some of the details of the deal from the public to avoid a backlash over concessions it made to Tokyo. Among the secret agreements were the Korean government\u2019s promise to \u201cpersuade\u201d a civic group supporting the victims -- the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan -- to accept the deal, as well as its promise not to support the erection of statues symbolizing sex slavery victims. The rights groups for the victims have called for abolishment of the deal made on Dec. 28, 2015 between Seoul and Tokyo, saying that the deal failed to reflect the victims\u2019 demands -- a sincere apology and legal compensation from the Japanese government. In the deal -- described by the two countries as \u201cfinal and irreversible\u201d -- Japan offered the funds to the foundation and an apology to the surviving victims in return for Seoul\u2019s promise not to raise the issue again in international forums. At the time of the agreement, only 47 victims of the 238 registered with the government were still alive, with their average age at 90.4. Now, only 32 victims remain. \u201cThe government is said to maintain a reserved stance on the issue for a while, separating the investigation result from its official position, due to the possible impact it could have on the PyeongChang Olympics next year,\u201d said Yoon Mi-hyang, president of the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. \u201cThe Moon government should take responsibility for the victims.\u201dThe civic group held this year\u2019s last weekly rally, the 1,315th, in downtown Seoul earlier in the day, with some 500 people in attendance. They paid tribute to victims and demanded the Korea-Japan deal be annulled.\u201cThe presidential office and then-ruling Saenuri Party touted the deal as a diplomatic achievement that none of the previous government had made when the deal was struck. All of them should be held accountable,\u201d said Park Jung-eun, secretary-general of the People\u2018s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy.A separate task force under the Gender Equality Ministry also unveiled a result of its probe into the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation. The foundation was established hastily following the bilateral deal and the ministry made aggressive efforts to persuade many of the reluctant victims to receive cash payments from the foundation, according to the internal probe. The ministry, however, said that it still has no immediate plan to disband the foundation. Japan\u2019s sexual enslavement of Korean women remains one of the key points of diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. According to historians, up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, are estimated to have worked as comfort women at Japan\u2019s front-line brothels during World War II.

Presidenet Moon Jae-in (C) speaks during a meeting with top economic policymakers and experts at the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul on Dec. 27, 2017. (Yonhap)Despite the sanguine forecast for 2018, Moon voiced concerns about a series of domestic economic challenges that have continued to threaten the livelihoods of ordinary South Koreans.\"Though economic indices are improving, individual citizens are not feeling them, as a matter of fact,\" he said, pointing to the high youth unemployment rate, hefty household debt and a series of market disadvantages weighing down on small enterprises.Moon described his job creation policy as one that citizens can directly benefit from. He has been pushing to create 174,000 new public service jobs by 2022 as part of his signature \"income-led growth\" strategy. \"Based on the creation of public service jobs, we have to create a boom for quality-job creation in the private sector,\" Moon said. \"I call for quickly improving various measures to support companies' job creation and hope that the private sector will actively cooperate.\"The president, in addition, called for progress in nurturing high-tech sectors such as autonomous vehicles, drones and smart factories and cities, and he stressed that \"innovative\" growth would help revitalize the economy and contribute to job growth.\"I want to call for bold efforts in the sector of innovative growth,\" he said.Moon also pointed out that such growth can be fueled by deregulation and directed top officials to immediately push for clearing onerous regulatory hurdles if possible. (Yonhap)","52":"The Park Geun-hye administration kept parts of the 2015 Korea-Japan agreement on Japan\u2019s wartime enslavement of Korean women in the dark, a South Korean task force confirmed Wednesday. The administration also pushed the deal despite the pact falling short of fundamentally resolving related issues.\u00a0A group of activists address the 2015 \"comfort women\" agreement outside the Central Government Complex in Seoul on Wednesday. (Yonhap)\u201cA victim-centered approach, which has become the norm when it comes to the human rights of women in times of war, was not sufficiently reflected and the deal was reached through give-and-take negotiations like an ordinary diplomatic agenda,\u201d a Foreign Ministry task force review released Wednesday said.The report addresses the controversial agreement signed between the Park government and Tokyo in 2015, which pushed both nations to \u201cfinally and irreversibly\u201d put the \u201ccomfort women\u201d issue behind them. \u201cComfort women\u201d is a euphemism for women who were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military during World War II.\u201cThe previous administration under former President Park Geun-hye used resolving the comfort women issue as a prerequisite to improving bilateral ties between South Korea and Japan, but its inflexible responses resulted in several burdens,\u201d it added. A team of nine public officials and experts looked into the yearslong negotiations and related procedures in the run-up to the announcement of the accord on Dec. 28, 2015, in a series of 20 meetings held over five months. A comprehensive database of relevant documents were provided by the Foreign Ministry here. The report said that the decision-making power was excessively concentrated in Cheong Wa Dae at the time and the South Korean government was incapable of separating historical issues from security and economic issues, when dealing with the matter. It noted insufficient cooperation and communication between the presidential office and the Foreign Ministry. The task force also confirmed the speculation that the previous government compromised too much and that this was undisclosed to the public to avoid backlash. Among the talks kept in secret, Japan told Seoul to refrain from supporting relevant civic groups disagreeing with the deal and to stop using the phrase \u201csexual slavery.\u201d It also requested detailed plans regarding \u201cgirl statues\u201d installed in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. Japan has often expressed its displeasure over civic groups\u2019 movement to build \u201cgirl statues\u201d embodying comfort women across South Korea and in other countries. In response to Japan\u2019s requests to remove the statues, the South Korean government said it had no authority to stop them but vowed to persuade the civic groups through consultation. The South Korean government also leaned toward Japan\u2019s opinion on choosing a phrase to describe the victims and affirmed the official term as \u201ccomfort women.\u201d\u201cThe undisclosed agreements did not directly block the South Korean government from relocating \u2018girl statues\u2019 nor using the expression \u2018sexual slavery,\u2019 but provided the Japanese government with an excuse to get involved in matters,\u201d the report said. The task force also said that despite the agreement, the issue remains largely \u201cunresolved,\u201d as the victims have not yet embraced it as a form of apology. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Wednesday acknowledged a significant lack of communication with \u201ccomfort women\u201d victims here, in reaching the agreement. The report also shed light on Japan\u2019s reluctance in acknowledging \u201clegal responsibility,\u201d which the victims and civic groups here view as a sign that Japan is not ready to make a formal apology. Instead, Tokyo made a 1 billion yen ($9 million) financial contribution to a victims\u2019 trust fund created by the agreement as its reparations mechanism, the report noted, but refused to link the money to any legal responsibility.\u201cFollowing the agreement, Japan has been saying that the fund is not linked to any legal responsibility,\u201d it said.\u201cSeveral victims and civic groups have said they cannot accept it, as it is not compensation. Thus, unless the issues surrounding \u2018responsibility\u2019 is completely resolved, the \u2018comfort women\u2019 issue remains fundamentally unresolved even if the victims received the money.\u201dThe report said the size of the fund was not set through an \u201cobjective standard of calculation\u201d and the task force failed to find records showing that the South Korean government took the victims\u2019 opinions into consideration during negotiations. It said that Japan is refusing to acknowledge formal legal responsibility for its actions because it believes the \u201ccomfort women\u201d issue was already resolved through the deal. But acknowledgement of legal responsibility for its crime was one of the key demands of the victims. On the term \u201cirreversible\u201d in the agreement, the task force said South Korea initially used the word to make Japan\u2019s apology more \u201cofficial,\u201d but it was later distorted in context when Tokyo used it to describe the \u201ccomfort women\u201d issue, in subsequent talks. Although it did not make any policy recommendations, the task force advised the government to come up with long-term solutions in dealing with historical issues. \u201cIt is difficult to resolve a historical problem such as the comfort women issue through short-term diplomatic negotiations or political compromise. There should be longer-term efforts for the spread of values, awareness and education for future generations.\u201dKang said in Wednesday\u2019s press briefing that the government will \u201cfaithfully\u201d accept the task force results and carefully form a stance on the issue, with South Korea-Japan relations in mind. \u201cBased on the findings, the government will gather opinions of the victims and others involved going forward with a focus to be placed on a victims-centered approach,\u201d Kang said. \u201cIn addition, action will be taken carefully in consideration of any impact that it could have on the relations between South Korea and Japan.\u201dPresident Moon Jae-in in May said he will revisit the deal, and the current administration said it would pursue a two-track approach of separating historical issues from diplomatic ties to Japan. Historians estimate up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery. There are currently 32 surviving \u201ccomfort women\u201d victims in South Korea.\u00a0By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)","53":"A four-day vote of confidence began Wednesday for People\u2019s Party Chairman Ahn Cheol-soo to decide on a proposed merger with the center-right Bareun Party.

(Yonhap)The question being posed to members is: \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of Chairman Ahn Cheol-soo who is pushing for a merger of the People\u2019s Party and the Bareun Party?\u201d The result is expected to be revealed early on Sunday, after the election committee begins counting the votes at 9 a.m. at its headquarters.While opposing party members held a meeting and continued their boycott of the vote, Ahn participated in a conference on political merger and reform hosted by the Bareun Party. \u201cFor two months, we have discussed the merger but we could not draw out an agreement. So I thought it was important to ask all members of the party, as they are the masters of the party,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cI have staked my all on this, because I believe the merger can change the history of South Korea.\u201dBareun Party chief Yoo Seong-min, who was also at the conference, welcomed Ahn.\u201cThe all-member party vote has begun today and I wish for a positive result,\u201d he said. Yoo also praised Ahn, saying he has never doubted Ahn\u2019s passion and will to reform South Korea. Ahn has long pushed for the merger, viewing it as crucial for the party to amass power against the ruling and the main opposition parties in the upcoming local elections slated for June. Merger talks had split the center-left party for a week, with key-figures such as former Floor Leader Park Jie-won opposing the move. In response, Ahn called for the all-member vote and said he would quit if the ballot goes against him. If the vote turns out in favor of Ahn, he said he would proceed with the merger process in January and complete the merger by February. A merger would create a 50-strong group, if all 11 lawmakers of Bareun Party and 39 lawmakers of People\u2019s Party join.The ruling Democratic Party of Korea holds 121 parliamentary seats and the main opposition Liberty Korea Party has 116. In a Realmeter survey released Tuesday, the People\u2019s Party garnered just 4.9 percent of support from 2,509 respondents, the lowest among the country\u2019s five major political parties and below the Bareun Party\u2019s 5.7 percent. The ruling Democratic Party topped the list with 52 percent, while the Liberty Korea Party posted at 17.8 percent.

They were convicted of similar charges and sentenced to four years in prison or given suspended terms by the lower court.The prosecution also demanded the defendants forfeit 7.89 billion won of assets hidden overseas.The court is to deliver its verdict on Lee and the four defendants on Feb. 5.\u00a0Lee, in the courtroom, once again pleaded not guilty.\u00a0\"I had a dream of being credited as a leader of a global company by managing Samsung to the best of my ability,\" he said. \"I am no fool to believe that I could succeed at it just with the help of a president... It may sound arrogant, but I had the confidence.\"The prosecution charged Lee and the other defendants with involvement in offering or promising 43.3 billion won of bribes to Park and Choi to win government support for a key merger of two Samsung units. The merger was seen as vital to his control of the business group in order to inherit the leadership from his ailing father Lee Kun-hee.\u00a0\u00a0\"Why would I ask for a favor to take over the leadership through bribes? I cannot admit (to the accusations),\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0The vice chairman said he feels terrible that the trial has deprived him of such a chance and that he feels lost as to how to recover his credibility as an entrepreneur, which has been tainted by the scandal.\u00a0\u00a0But he opted to take the blame for all the criticism and asked for leniency on his executives.\u00a0\"The skein of threads have gotten tangled in such a complicated and messed-up way and one thing for sure is that everything is on me,\" Lee said. \"I take all the legal and ethical responsibilities and other defendants are only here because they worked for the company.\"Special Counsel Park Young-soo refuted the defendants' argument of insisting the donations were part of fulfilling their social responsibilities.\u00a0\"Claiming the illegal sponsoring, including the purchase of a high-end steed and massive funding to Choi's foundations using its affiliates' assets, to be donations is an insult to true corporate philanthropy.\"The lower court did not acknowledge as bribes part of the money including the group's donation of some 20.4 billion won to the two foundations allegedly controlled by Choi and 13.5 billion won which were not actually provided.\u00a0The defendants argued that they only accepted Park's demands for fear of retaliation and never sought any government favors in return.\u00a0Lee continued to deny that his first one-on-one encounter with the former president had already taken place prior to the two meetings he has admitted.\u00a0\"I only met the ex-president in her safe house twice ...

Some have argued Pyongyang seeks to possess nuclear-tipped long-range missiles for its regime survival, while others have said it wants to bolster its bargaining power in future negotiations with Washington or Seoul. Hong Joon-pyo, the leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, speaks during a lecture for university students at Busan City Hall in the southern port city, 450 kilometers south of Seoul, on Dec. 27, 2017. (Yonhap)Concerns have also risen that the completion of the North's ICBM program could undercut the South Korea-US alliance, as it could put American cities at risk and thus weaken the credibility of Washington's security commitment to Seoul.During the lecture, Hong also pointed to the Donald Trump administration's \"America First\" mantra, raising doubts over whether Washington can quickly come to the defense of Seoul if it is in a security crisis.\"The US is a country that puts the foremost priority on its national interests. The issue of South Korea comes next (for Washington),\" he said.Hong, in addition, said that the period between late autumn and early spring is when the likelihood of war rises, as he pressed the government to devise a stronger security policy against an increasingly provocative Pyongyang.\"By March next year, the situation is the most dangerous.

YonhapThe idea of postponing joint drills that coincide with the games was first publicly raised by President Moon Jae-in during an interview with US broadcaster NBC on Dec. 19. The Winter Olympics will take place from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25 and the Paralympics from March 9 to March 18. Seoul and Washington are reportedly discussing possible options in changing the dates of the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises. Speaking to VOA, Burwell Bell, a retired US Army general who served as the USFK commander from 2006 to 2008, said that carrying out drills during the games is undesirable. Bell, however, stressed that the drills should be carried out immediately after the games, and that military readiness cannot be a tool in negotiating with North Korea. \u201cAny notion by anyone that exercises should be postponed to achieve some kind of diplomatic engagement is wrong. I agree they could be postponed for (a) very short period of time so as to accommodate the conducts of the Olympics, but it is crucial that those exercises be conducted to their full range of requirements immediately following the Olympics,\u201d Bell was quoted as saying by VOA. Should the allies compromise their military readiness to deal with Pyongyang, troops and citizens of the two countries would be put in danger, Bell said, adding that he would then advise the US to end the alliance. Bell also said that until China takes a more active role, war is the only option the US has in preventing North Korea from becoming capable of carrying out a pre-emptive nuclear strike. \u201cQuite frankly, until China decides that is in their best interests for the North to give up their nuclear weapons, nothing we can do short of going to war will stop the North\u2019s efforts to gain nuclear first strike capability. This is in China\u2019s hands.\u201dSimilar views were echoed by Bell\u2019s predecessors James Thurman and John Tilelli. Thurman, who held the post from 2011 to 2013, told VOA that he thinks that changing the dates of the drills should be considered. Thurman, however, warned that North Korea must not be allowed to take possible changes in the dates as signs that the allies are trying to appease the regime, saying that such measures have failed in the past. \u201cI think the exercises are essential to maintaining the required readiness to defend the peninsula and to protect the South Korean people,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIf North Korea is interested in reducing tensions, they need to quit launching and testing ballistic missiles and denuclearize. The military drills are necessary to maintaining the readiness required by the alliance.\u201dTilelli, who led the USFK between 1996 and 1999, also said that there may be value in delaying the drills, but emphasized that joint drills are central to the allies\u2019 military readiness.

It called for the government to come up with a longer-term approach to resolve such a historical matter as the so-called comfort women issue, saying that \"give-and-take\" negotiations or political compromise could not be the ultimate solution.\"A victims-centered approach, which has become the norm when it comes to the human rights of women in time of war, has not been sufficiently reflected and the deal was reached through give-and-take negotiations like an ordinary diplomatic agenda\" the task force said in its 31-page report on the outcome of its review.\"The agreement was finalized mostly based on government views without adequately taking into account the opinions of victims in the process of negotiation,\" it added. This file photo dated on Dec. 28, 2015, shows then South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se (R) and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida shake hands after announcing an agreement to resolve the issue of Japan`s wartime sexual slaver. (Yonhap)The task force's findings will be presented to the government, which will finalize its stance on the matter, with no detailed timetable yet disclosed. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha expressed regret that the deal lacked the opinions of those involved and that the government will accept the task force's findings that she believes are \"faithfully\"answering questions surrounding the issue. \"Based on the findings, the government will gather opinions of the victims and others involved going forward with a focus to be placed on a victims-centered approach,\" Kang said. \"In addition, action will be taken carefully in consideration of any impact that it could have on the relations between South Korea and Japan.\"The task force composed of government officials and private-sector experts on history and relations with Japan was launched two months after the Moon Jae-in government took office to review the much-criticized deal reached under the previous Park Geun-hye administration. South Korea and Japan reached the deal on Dec. 28, 2015, under which they agreed to \"finally and irreversibly\" resolve the comfort women issue, while Tokyo apologized for its colonial-era atrocities and agreed to contribute 1 billion yen (US$8.9 million) to a foundation dedicated to supporting the victims.The deal, however, prompted strong criticism from victims and civic groups who claim that Japan's apology was not sincere enough and that the government did not consult with them in advance. Some call for renegotiating or even scrapping the deal.The task force said that the controversial wording \"irreversibly\" was proposed by the Korean side to make sure that Japan's apology would be permanent and not be taken back, a context distorted when Japan demanded the \"final\" and \"irreversible resolution\" to the comfort women issue, which was accepted in subsequent talks. Seoul's foreign minister advised the presidential office to drop the word \"irreversible\" but this was not accepted, according to the task force.The task force also apparently confirmed the speculation that South Korea compromised too much in their negotiations and that this fact was not made public so as to minimize public backlash.Under the undisclosed agreements, Japan demanded the Seoul government not support relevant civic groups when they voiced their displeasure in relation to the deal and asked for\u00a0 detailed plans for a statue of a girl in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul.The girl statue symbolizing the hardship of comfort women has been regarded as an eyesore by Japan. Japan has frequently asked for its removal on the basis that it was part of the 2015 deal. The Seoul government denied any such agreement, saying that it has no authority to do so since the statue was built by civic groups. In response, South Korea promised to make efforts of \"persuasion\" regarding the civic groups, while working to \"appropriately\" resolve the matter of the statue through consultations with the relevant organizations, according to the task force. Responding to Tokyo's call for not using the phrase \"sexual slavery\" in referring to Japan's wartime history, the Seoul government affirmed that the official term is \"comfort women\" for those who served at frontline brothels, effectively giving into Japan's demand.The task force said that the whole negotiating process -- a total of eight rounds of high-level talks starting February 2015 -- was driven by Cheong Wa Dae, and it took issue with the concentration of decision-making authority in the presidential office during the process. It also noted that the foreign ministry, which was supposed to take a lead, failed to do so and its opinions were not sufficiently reflected in the deal.The task force did not provide policy recommendations on the matter but advised the government to seek longer-term solutions to historical matters like the comfort women issue.\"It is hard to resolve such a historical problem as the comfort women issue through short-term diplomatic negotiations or political compromise. There should be longer-term efforts for the spread of values, awareness and education for future generations.\"Japan has urged South Korea to faithfully carry out what was agreed upon. The Moon government has said that there appears to have been procedural problems but that it will seek a \"two-track\"approach in which such historical issues will be separated from bilateral diplomatic relations.Korea was under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-45. Historians estimate that up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced into sexual servitude during World War II. The number of surviving South Korean victims currently stands at 32.

(Yonhap)On Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in called for more effective measures to boost South Korea's low fertility rate as he warned of a serious demographic crisis.South Korea has spent 100 trillion won (US$93 billion) over the past decade to tackle the low birth rate, though no significant progress has been made yet.Many young people delay marriage as they cannot find decent jobs after graduating university, which in turn has led to a low birth rate.South Korea's total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime -- stood at 1.17 in 2016, much lower than the replacement level of 2.1 that would keep South Korea's population of 51 million stable.Coupled with a rapidly aging population, low births can reduce the available workforce in Asia's fourth-largest economy and drive up welfare costs, which in turn could undermine the economy's growth potential.Meanwhile, the number of marriages dropped 20.9 percent on-year to 17,400 in October, while 8,400 couples divorced during the cited period, down 5.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the data.The number of deaths came to 24,600 for the month, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.

The North has conducted all of its six nuclear tests at the site located in the country's northeastern province.Seoul selected the defectors who expressed hope to undergo the tests among 114 refugees who came from the county after North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. All of the examinees came to the South before the North's fourth nuke test in January 2016.The ministry said that chromosome abnormality analysis examinations showed that four defectors may have been exposed to radiation, but it cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as age and smoking could have affected the result. Satellite imagery shows North Korea`s nuclear test site in a photo released by 38 North. (Yonhap)Among them, two cases showed no statistical meaning. For one refugee, an impact of an old age, smoking and uses of computed tomography for medical purposes cannot be excluded.For the remaining person, a shortage of information stands in the way in gauging whether signs of radiation leaks are related to nuclear detonations.\"The possibility of radiation exposure can be suspected, but it has not been verified whether nuclear tests affected the person as there is a lack of information assessing living environments in North Korea,\" a ministry official said.The government also said that there were no cases of meaningful results in checking possible radioactive contamination.The official said that four of the 114 defectors from Kilju County had lived close to the Punggye-ri nuclear site, but he declined to identify how many examinees in the latest checkups came from the location.Experts expressed concerns that the series of nuclear tests may have caused radioactive substances to leak into nearby areas, possibly putting residents' health at risk. Exposure to radiation could raise the risk of developing leukemia and other types of cancer.The ministry admitted that the latest medical tests have a limitation, given the small sampling and a lack of information. Also a long time has passed since the examinees were possibly exposed to radiation.The government said that it plans to advise North Korean defectors to receive heath checkups at regular intervals. It will also carry out further radiation tests on more refugees.

While varying in detail, the media reports claimed Im\u2019s trip concerned the nuclear power plant construction and maintenance contract that a South Korean consortium had won in 2009. Some claimed Im was sent to delve into past administrations\u2019 wrongdoings related to the contract, while others claimed Im was tasked with appeasing UAE leaders\u2019 discontent at Moon\u2019s policy of reducing reliance on nuclear power.

The term \u201ccomfort women\u201d is a euphemism for women who were forced into military sexual servitude by Japan during World War II. \u201cThe conclusion is that there was a significant lack of communication with the victims before the deal was made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the result that we have expected but now we can say that with sufficient review and evidence.\u201dKang\u2019s remarks came a day ahead of the announcement of the outcome of a five-month review of the controversial deal signed between Seoul and Tokyo two years ago.

(Yonhap)","91":"Political tensions over a constitutional revision deepened Tuesday, as rival parties blamed one another for a deadlock in talks over extending the term of a special parliamentary panel on the highly polarizing issue.Last week, the parties failed to pass a motion to extend the panel's term, slated to end this month, due to their differences over when to hold a public vote on rewriting the basic law that many say fails to reflect social and political changes since its last revision in 1987.The ruling Democratic Party maintains it would back the extension only if the main opposition Liberty Korea Party agrees to its plan to hold a referendum on it in tandem with the local elections slated for next June.But the LKP opposes the idea of concurrently holding the elections and referendum, saying the revision issue could be politicized in favor of the liberal ruling bloc. It also argues that the amendment needs \"sufficient\" time for deliberations.Such gaps have led to a breakup of last-minute negotiations over the extension Friday, raising the prospect of the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae undertaking the job of drafting a revision motion -- anathema to the opposition bloc. Woo Won-shik (R), the floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party, speaks during a party meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul on Dec. 26, 2017. (Yonhap)\"While our party has made bold concessions, the LKP has maintained an uncompromising attitude,\" Woo Won-shik, the ruling party's floor leader, said during a meeting with senior party officials.Woo cautioned that the constitutional revision must not be approached from any partisan perspective, and that the LKP must agree to the idea of holding the referendum on the revision together with the local elections.The ruling party that only has 121 seats in the 299-member parliament needs opposition parties' cooperation to even submit the bill for a revision.Tabling the proposal for a constitutional change requires backing from a majority of all lawmakers. The parliamentary passage needs support from two-thirds of the total legislators. It then has to win majority support in a referendum involving a majority of eligible voters.Amid the LKP's insistence on holding a referendum on the revision after the local elections, speculation has been rising that the ruling party might seek to push for it with cooperation with other opposition parties, such as the People's Party.But Kim Dong-cheol, the floor leader of the People's Party, rejected the possibility of bypassing the main opposition party in the parliamentary passage of the revision.\"The claim about the skipping of the main opposition party is nothing but a 'political alibi' or a ploy to shift the responsibility for any failure of the amendment efforts,\" Kim said during a party meeting.Kim also opposed the prospect of the presidential office leading the revision spadework.\"If Cheong Wa Dae or the government spearheads the revision talks, it would be difficult to solicit public opinions and views from all parties, in which case the possibility of its parliamentary endorsement would be little,\" he said.Shifting the blame to the ruling party for the failure to pass the extension of the revision panel, a group of first-term LKP lawmakers reiterated that the revision referendum must take place after the local elections.\"(The ruling party's argument) is to set the time limit for the revision vote and just cobble together the amendment motion within the time frame,\" the group said in a joint statement. \"It is a move that disregards the aspirations of citizens who expect the Republic of Korea's new Constitution, and a move that virtually opposes a practical amendment.\"\u00a0 The discussions over the revision center on reshaping the governance structure to diffuse the power that is concentrated in a president. Some lawmakers have called for introducing a semi-presidential system -- a mixture of the presidential system and parliamentary Cabinet system -- under which more power is assigned to the prime minister. Others have espoused a purely parliamentary Cabinet system like in Japan.During his election campaign, President Moon Jae-in called for changing the current single-term, five-year presidency into a four-year presidency that allows for only one re-election.

The Seoul government is saying that it will seek a \"two-track\" approach in which such historical issues will be separated from bilateral diplomatic relations.\"The task force's review is about the procedure by which the deal was reached and its evaluation, not about any policy recommendations,\" Kang said. \"What diplomatic policy the government is to take does not rely entirely on the review outcome.\"\"The outcome should be taken into account but there should be communication with the victims as well.\"Kang declined to elaborate on what the task force will announce but noted that the previous government surely did not make enough efforts to communicate with the victims. \"The conclusion is that communication with victims lacked significantly until the deal was finally made,\" she said. \"It is the conclusion that we have expected but now we can say that with sufficient review and evidence.\"Kang said that \"all options\" should remain open on what action the government will take on the deal she said about 70 percent of Korean people cannot accept.

On North Korea and its nuclear issues, Kang said that the government will closely review all scenarios including additional provocations and a possible resumption of talks to deal with its growing threats. With regard to China and bilateral ties that have been chilled over the deployment of a US missile defense system here, Kang reaffirmed that the leaders of the two countries shared the view to normalize their relations \"in the mid and long term.\"\"Based on the shared view to put cooperation and exchanges in all areas, including personnel exchanges, back on track, our ministry, for its part, will make all-out efforts,\" she said.

(Yonhap)The ministry will also establish a division specializing in coping with the North's nuclear program in close coordination with the Nuclear and WMD Response Center of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is in charge of military operations.The Counter WMD Division will be reorganized into the Missile & Space Policy Division, while the North Korea Policy Division and the Arms Control Division will be maintained, according to the ministry.\"The (new) director general of North Korea policy will be in charge of the four divisions,\" it said. \"The reorganization this time is meaningful in that the Ministry of National Defense has set up a system necessary to effectively deter and respond to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.\"It's also expected to support the government's push for denuclearizing Korea, building inter-Korean military trust and bringing peace to the peninsula, added the ministry.","95":"The cold snap that hit Korea earlier this month is expected to return Tuesday, with lows of minus 8 to 6 degrees Celsius nationwide.The temperatures will rebound to minus 5 to 11 C by midday, slightly warmer than Monday\u2019s weather, but strong winds are expected to plunge the country back into sub-zero temperatures at night.\u00a0(Yonhap)The bitterly cold conditions are forecast to rebound at the end of the week.Clear skies will be seen in most regions of the country in the morning, except Chungcheong, North Jeolla provinces and some parts of west coast areas where less than 1 centimeter of snow is expected to fall.

During their summit on Dec. 14, Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to put director-level consultations channels between the two governments back on track after a monthslong feud over the deployment of a US missile defense system called THAAD in South Korea.\u00a0 (Yonhap)South Korea and China announced on Oct. 31 that they will cooperate to normalize their ties in many areas that had been strained for months over the THAAD deployment.The agreement raised expectations that China would move to lift what is regarded as retaliatory measures against South Korean companies and products. Reports, however, suggest relevant efforts have not been under way fast enough, with some group tours bound for South Korea recently banned again. Yoon is likely to call on Beijing to step up its efforts to normalize bilateral relations in many areas, observers said. (Yonhap)","97":"A fire occurred at the construction site of an apartment complex in Suwon, south of Seoul on Monday, claiming one life and injuring 14 people, firefighters said. YonhapThe blaze, which occurred at around 2:46 p.m., is presumed to have started by welding being done by construction workers at the site, they said.An unidentified man was found dead and 12 workers were taken to hospitals for smoke inhalation. Two firefighters sustained fire burns during rescue work.It took almost three hours to contain the fire with 57 pieces of fire-fighting equipment including six helicopters, and about 120 firefighters mobilized.As black fumes shrouded the site, some residents in nearby apartments were evacuated for safety, they said.Police and firefighters are investigating the cause of the fire.The fire occurred days after a big blaze engulfed an eight-story fitness center building in the central city of Jecheon last week, leaving 29 people dead and 29 others injured. (Yonhap)","98":"The new year will usher in a slew of new rules and regulations. From public toilets to schools and churches, the changes will affect South Koreans\u2019 daily life. Here is a look at some of the new rules to come into effect in 2018. Bye-bye toilet trash cansStarting from Jan. 1, all public bathrooms are required to do away with trash bins and provide rapid dissolving toilet paper, hopefully resolving one of the most common complaints of foreign visitors here.\u00a0 YonhapThe move comes as part of changes brought by the Cabinet, which in May passed a revision to the implementation ordinance of the Public Toilets, Etc. Act, the law governing public toilets. Under the amendment, garbage cans inside all bathroom stalls for both male and female restrooms will be removed. Bins with covers will be installed instead for the disposal of feminine hygiene products. Also, janitors and cleaning staff will be asked to place signs at the entrance of bathrooms when cleaning facilities for opposite genders. Among other changes is the introduction of bigger bathroom dividers -- 40 centimeters in width and 60 centimeters in length -- between urinals for men. \u201cWe hope other privately owned restrooms catch up with the newly introduced changes such as public restrooms without toilet trash bins, signs for cleaners of a different sex, more enclosed restroom designs and barriers between urinals,\u201d said Yoon Jong-in, a senior official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.Taxes on clergy Effective Jan. 1, priests, pastors, Buddhist monks and clergy of other religions will be levied income tax.\u00a0 A group of activists from the Korea Taxpayers` Association hold a protest rally in front of the State Affairs Planning Advisory Committee building in central Seoul on May 31, 2017, demanding that clerical workers pay taxes like all waged workers. (Yonhap)Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s 35 member countries, Korea was the only allowing exemptions for religious leaders. A related revision in the nation\u2019s tax code passed the National Assembly years ago, but its implementation was delayed due to opposition from religious circles. The clergy group\u2019s tax burden, however, is envisioned to be just about half of that shouldered by ordinary wage earners, according to a Financial Ministry plan to be finalized Friday. A religious leader with a three-person household who earns 28.85 million won ($26,700) a year and has one child under the age of 20 would pay a monthly withholding tax of just 1,330 won. The 28.85 million won is the average annual income of pastors, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Labor Ministry. For an annual income of 50 million won, a clergyperson leading a four-person household would shoulder 50,730 won in monthly income taxes, whereas nonclergy would pay 90,510 won. The Finance Ministry estimates roughly 16-20 billion won will be collected annually from around 50,000 religious leaders. No English for grades 1-2 Starting from March 1, elementary schools are banned from running English courses for first- and second-graders under the motto \u201cNo study burden on young kids.\u201d\u00a0 After-school teachers stage a protest in front of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education on Friday, demonstrating against the government`s decision to ban after-school English classes for first- and second-graders. (Bak Se-hwan\/The Korea Herald)Currently, English is taught from the third grade onward, but schools offer first- and second-graders after-hours courses in English. The global language is by far parents\u2019 favorite among all extension programs. A law banning advanced learning to normalize the competition-driven education culture was adopted in September 2014, but after-school English curriculum remained intact due to strong demand from parents. Parents and thousands of English instructors, who are set to lose their jobs, are protesting the looming shutdown, but the Education Ministry appears firm this time. Some critics say the ban would deprive students of access to affordable English education and benefit private institutions. Minimum wage, vacation days and jobsThe minimum wage for 2018 is set at 7,530 won per hour, up 16.4 percent, or 1,060 won, from a year earlier. This is the first time for the bottom limit of wages to rise by more than 1,000 won at a time.\u00a0President Moon Jae-in, having proclaimed a doctrine of \u201cincome-led economic growth,\u201d aims to raise the rate to 10,000 won during his presidency, which ends in 2022, but said he would adjust the pace of the wage increases after watching how this year\u2019s spike affects labor cost-sensitive sectors and SMEs. From June, newly hired employees will be entitled to 11 days of paid leave in the first year. So far, workers have become entitled only after completing a full year of service. Also there will be 24,300 job openings in the public service through 2018, including for teachers, police officers, firefighters and central and provincial government employees. The hiring scheme compares to previous years\u2019 average of around 8,000. What\u2019s a gift and what\u2019s a bribe Since September 2016, civil servants, journalists, teachers and their spouses have been banned from receiving gifts, free meals and congratulations or condolences of certain monetary values, under the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.\u00a0 123rfThe price ceilings are to be adjusted before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, a traditional gift-giving season, although the exact date of its implementation has yet to be determined. As for gifts, the cap is unchanged at 50,000 won, but there is a new exception: Up to 100,000 won is OK when the gifts are agricultural, livestock and fishery goods. The ceiling on gift money on occasions like weddings and funerals is down to 50,000 won from the previous 100,000 won.

And they just kept filling in the plot. The sheer scale of construction seemed to suggest it was done by the private sector rather than the state.\u201d\u00a0The Future Scientist Avenue in Pyongyang (Calvin Chua)Yim, an assistant professor at Hongik University\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design, noted that sea changes have taken place in Pyongyang over the last five years under Kim Jong-un. The third-generation autocrat vowed to remake his country through a dual-track national development strategy known as the \u201cByungjin line,\u201d pursuing nuclear and economic development simultaneously.As the international community piles sanctions on the North for its reckless military provocations, Pyongyang, time and time again, seems to defy expectations of being pressured to abandon its nuclear aspirations. By continuing the construction of towering buildings and new blocks, the regime legitimizes its ability to withstand external threats and consolidates its grip on power, analysts say.\u00a0 Yim Dong-woo, assistant professor at Hongik University\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Socialist city on the moveFor starters, Pyongyang is unlike any other city in the world. Built on the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War that reduced the city to rubble, Pyongyang was designed by architect Kim Jung-hee (1921-75) who was commissioned by North Korean founder Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un. Having studied at Moscow Architectural Institute from 1947-53, Kim Jung-hee masterminded Pyongyang as a \u201csocialist city\u201d built on modernist urban planning principles, as previously theorized by visionary architect Le Corbusier.Unlike capitalist cities that prioritize economic efficiency, and consequently agglomerate, socialist cities place spatial equality above everything else and attempt to materialize equality in the built space. As an example, they are designed to provide equal distances between home and work through a concept called the \u201cmicrodistrict\u201d -- a self-sufficient neighborhood that incorporates residences, factories, shops, schools, day care centers, health care facilities, leisure spaces and more.According to Yim, who authored \u201cUnprecedented Pyongyang\u201d and \u201cPyongyang and After Pyongyang\u201d as well as other papers on its urban planning, design and architecture, the showpiece capital can be analyzed through the prisms of productive space, ideological space and ecological space.North Korea\u2019s accelerating marketization over the last two decades -- triggered by the breakdown of the rationing system following the \u201carduous march\u201d of the 1990s -- has meant that construction is now largely driven by money. Vast networks of corrupt, kleptocratic relationships exist between bureaucrats and the nouveau rich known as \u201cdonju.\u201d\u00a0 Mansudae Apartment blocks in Pyongyang (Calvin Chua)Yim\u2019s research has focused on the potential transformation of Pyongyang and North Korean cities after the prospective fall of the regime. By studying the capitalist renewal of Eastern and Central European cities as well as Chinese cities, one can gauge the metamorphoses that North Korean cities might experience, he said. \u201cThe concept of microdistrict is interesting,\u201d Yim continued, noting that although microdistricts do not seem to be built or used any longer in large quantities, they hold the key to unlocking North Korean neighborhoods\u2019 potential for locally centered development. He is the co-founder and principal of architectural design and research firm Praud, and studied at Seoul National University and Harvard University. Yim\u2019s work on Pyongyang has recently been displayed at the Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism at Dongdaemun Design Plaza.\u201cI heard from a Japanese economist who has traveled to North Korea numerous times that various self-sufficient micro initiatives are happening across neighborhoods. As an example, women produce clothes within a cooperative and sell them to their neighbors for a profit.\u201dSuch a basic form of autarkic production and consumption may act as a seedbed of entrepreneurship once capitalism rushes in systematically, he conjectured, a view empirically substantiated by aggrandizing businesses in European cities transitioning from communism to capitalism. Yim also pointed to models of locally based sustainable production and consumption that have gained global traction, such as the sharing economy and urban farming. \u201cThe point of these initiatives is to make our society more wholesome and healthful,\u201d he said.Providing spaces for consumption will be one of the most fundamental issues following a hypothetical unification, Yim asserted.\u00a0A North Korean family plays music at home in Pyongyang. (AFP\/Yonhap)\u201cLooking at the experiences of former communist Europe, we know that providing spaces for commerce is critical. The Eastern and Central Europeans, long starved of shopping, went ecstatic over buying after the Iron Curtain fell,\u201d he said.\u00a0Although one can\u2019t predict how Pyongyang and other North Korean cities will change after unification, it is possible to illuminate the proper directions they should take to be economically vibrant and sustainable, he added. Yim suggested the underground and surrounding areas of Kim Il-sung Square to be developed as an integrated commercial space -- encompassing convention centers, hotels and other shopping and cultural amenities -- similar to Seoul\u2019s Coex, or retail and cultural venues encircling Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.\u201cThe hammer and the sickle and communist propaganda posters are likely to be replaced by advertisements of Samsung, LG, Apple and Hallyu celebrities,\u201d forecast the architect. \u201cAnother foreseeable change is the commodification and gentrification of waterfront areas, as they have latent property and aesthetic value. The Future Scientist Avenue on Taedong River across Yanggak Island is a recently developed, posh area, and has a lot of potential for commercialization.\u201d North Koreans mourn the death of the late Kim Jong-il on the sixth anniversary of his death on Dec. 17 at the Kumsoonsan Palace of the Sun, one of many ideological sites in the revolutionary capital Pyongyang. (Yonhap)Potemkin city Pyongyang, the showpiece capital of the country with an estimated population of over 25 million, is home to 3 million residents, some 500,000 of whom constitute the regime\u2019s core. It has been cultivated over the years to flaunt the Kim dynasty\u2019s insuperable ideology and the nation\u2019s heroic struggle against its archenemies \u201cAmerican imperialists.\u201d\u201cIdeological architecture has existed eternally with mankind and operated actively on people\u2019s ideological consciousness across generations,\u201d wrote the late Kim Jong-il in \u201cTheory on Architectural Art.\u201d \u201cTherefore, architecture is not limited to the question of technical engineering, but ultimately arrives at the question of ideology and thought.\u201dIn his \u201cArchitectural and Cultural Guide Pyongyang,\u201d German architect Philipp Meuser described Pyongyang as \u201can experimental city under hermetic surveillance, where all lives are compartmentalized succinctly; an outdoor museum that most visibly preserves the socialist architectural style.\u201d\u201cThose who visit Pyongyang feel an eerie perfection in its cityscape compared to cities in democracies,\u201d he added.Once spawned as a socialist city, Pyongyang, not immune from market forces, has metamorphosed over the years to become something of a jumbled metropolis. People walk before the statues of late North Korean leaders Kim Il-Sung (left) and Kim Jong-Il after laying flowers to mark the sixth anniversary of the death of the late Kim Jong-Il, at Mansu hill in Pyongyang on Dec. 17, 2017. (AFP\/Yonhap)The period of 1945-53 after the Japanese colonial rule and internecine war saw buildings constructed in a style that combined traditional and modern forms. The postwar period from 1953-60 was marked by flats in the modernist-socialist style, modeled after the townhouses and multistory row houses of Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Brigades of prefabricated apartments were hastily manufactured through the early 1970s, leading to the expression \u201cPyongyang speed,\u201d as a housing unit was reputedly completed every 14 minutes.The period after the mid-1970s witnessed the construction of high-rise apartment blocks, accelerating into the 1980s and early 1990s with super high-rise blocks of 20- to 40-story buildings on Munsoo Street, Changgwang Street, Budnamu Street, Ansangtaek Street, Chollima Street, Gwangbok Street and Tongil Street. Unlike South Korean cities that are administratively organized into \u201cdongs,\u201d or districts, in North Korean cities streets dominate the landscape.Not much was built in the 1990s due to the country\u2019s economic collapse. But since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, he has invested much of his energy into pet projects in Pyongyang. Changjon Street and Ryomyong Street have been the centerpieces of his vertical ambition, housing 4,300 luxury residential units in 55- to 70-story buildings. He even instituted a state agency and research center commissioned with overseeing the nighttime lighting of iconic streets, buildings and monuments. \u201cIt seems that North Korean policymakers don\u2019t understand where to invest money to grow the economy,\u201d opined Seoul National University economics professor Kim Byung-yeon. \u201cKim Jong-un seems to think that making a country modern requires building modern apartments. But rather, super high-rise buildings are a symptom of North Korea\u2019s economic malaise and inequality. Money gravitates toward construction because it can\u2019t be invested elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0 The interior of a North Korean model house displayed at the Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism at Dongdaemun Design Plaza. (Calvin Chua)The donju collude with power institutions and brokers to build apartments, bribing and giving them half of what\u2019s to be constructed and selling the remainder on the market, notes Dong-a Ilbo journalist Joo Seong-ha, who escaped from North Korea in 1998. The price of the most sought-after apartment units in Pyongyang can fetch anywhere from $150,000 to $200,000, say defectors, and residents who occupy these luxury homes enjoy a lavish lifestyle.There are reportedly even sales of units before construction begins, a system likely copied from South Korea\u2019s real estate industry. Speculative investment also exists, leading in some cases to real estate bubbles.Rich children of the People\u2019s Republic, making up the \u201c1 percent,\u201d live in what has been dubbed \u201cPyonghattan\u201d to describe the parallel universe of top-down privilege and wealth, according to a Washington Post article last year. It claimed the wealthy there wear Zara and H&M; clothes, drink cappuccinos, eat top-grade steak, go under the knife for cosmetic makeovers and run on treadmills at health clubs.It has become vogue among economic elites to refashion their home interiors in the style of posh residences in the South. Taking inspiration from South Korean interior magazines and TV dramas, some donju and high-ranking bureaucrats splurge up to $6,000 on furnishings, such as ritzy large-scale mirrors, bidet-added toilets and security camera-equipped automatic doors, reported Daily NK. Soldiers from units originally tasked with construction toil night and day to do the work.\u00a0 A photo taken on November 15, 2017 shows a general view of a street in central Pyongyang. North Korea's sprint towards full-fledged nuclear statehood accelerated sharply in 2017, raising fears about a devastating atomic exchange to levels not seen since the Cold War. (AFP\/Yonhap)But underneath the glitz, homes are dilapidated, in short supply and poorly supplied with water, heating, sewage and electricity. Particularly in winter, those living in high-rise apartments, where central heating is a luxury, are known to move to relatives\u2019 residences heated by coal or solar panels, or elsewhere through a broker. Because the elevators in many apartments don\u2019t operate due to power shortages, the lower floors are more expensive, reporter Joo pointed out. \u201cIn contrast to South Korea where the upper floors are a symbol of status and wealth, in Pyongyang people try hard to \u2018climb down\u2019 to the lower floors, often paying lucrative sums,\u201d he said. The reckless speed at which construction and demolition are carried out frequently leads to on-site deaths and shoddy structures, periodically resulting in the collapse of buildings. A building collapsed on Ryomyong Street in April last year, reportedly killing some 60 workers, and in May 2014, a 23-story apartment crumbled and killed an estimated 300 residents. Sustainable city Come unification and capitalism, how would Pyongyang change? Or how should it change to keep pace with the times? Once the restriction on freedom of movement and right to live in Pyongyang is lifted, people will flock toward the city in search of work and opportunities, according to Seoul National University professor Choi Mack-joong, who teaches urban planning at the Graduate School of Environmental Studies.\u00a0Choi Mack-joong, professor at Seoul National University\u2019s Graduate School of Environmental Studies (Joel Lee\/The Korea Herald)Choi advised creating satellite cities around Pyongyang, or new towns inside the city, to accommodate newcomers. As most of the housing stock would be outdated and structurally unstable, large-scale reconstruction is inevitable, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to legally recognize their private residential ownership, which formally belongs to the state now. We should grant people the right to buy and sell homes in a market,\u201d Choi said in an interview at his office. \u201cThat would vitalize a property market, creating market-based prices based on which people could establish their material basis of life. It would also reduce economic gaps between North and South Koreans.\u201d One likely contentious issue from the process is vast economic inequality between the haves and have-nots, as amply evidenced in former communist Europe. But it is important to incentivize the elites toward unification by promising their continuing prosperity, the professor contended. Similar to the East Germans, \u201cThe single biggest concern for North Koreans will be how they can live stable, prosperous lives, as opposed to some lofty political ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is critical to spread the message that unification would lead to that.\u201d\u00a0 A street in Pyongyang (Yonhap)Choi stressed that policies should protect Pyongyang\u2019s urban characteristics and cultural and historical heritage. Similar to Eastern European cities, some of Pyongyang\u2019s ideological space -- as sites of identity and character -- could be preserved rather than demolished, he advised. One illustrative case of a former communist structure being used into capitalism is the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, Romania. Built by Romania\u2019s last communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, a close ally to Kim Il-sung who bulldozed Bucharest in the image of Pyongyang, the palace is the world\u2019s largest administrative building, housing the Romanian parliament, three museums and an international conference center. \u201cFor Pyongyang to become a city of life from a mythical, fossilized city, it\u2019s important to create open channels of communications between citizens,\u201d said professor Byeon Chang-heum of Sejong University\u2019s Department of Public Administration. \u201cSimilar to the way Gwangju has been reborn as a city championing human rights, and Hiroshima as a city of peace, Pyongyang can be remade as a city of democracy, rising above layers of totalitarian oppression.\u201d By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)"}," section":{"0":"Social affairs","1":"Social affairs","2":"Politics","3":"North Korea","4":"North Korea","5":"Social affairs","6":"Social affairs","7":"North Korea","8":"North Korea","9":"Social affairs","10":"Politics","11":"North Korea","12":"North Korea","13":"Social affairs","14":"North Korea","15":"Social affairs","16":"Social affairs","17":"Defense","18":"North Korea","19":"North Korea","20":"North Korea","21":"Politics","22":"North Korea","23":"Foreign Policy","24":"Social affairs","25":"Social affairs","26":"Defense","27":"North Korea","28":"Social affairs","29":"Social affairs","30":"Foreign Policy","31":"Social affairs","32":"Social affairs","33":"Education","34":"Politics","35":"North Korea","36":"Defense","37":"Politics","38":"Social affairs","39":"North Korea","40":"Social affairs","41":"Foreign Policy","42":"North Korea","43":"Social affairs","44":"Social affairs","45":"Social affairs","46":"North Korea","47":"Social affairs","48":"Social affairs","49":"National","50":"Social affairs","51":"Politics","52":"Foreign Policy","53":"Politics","54":"Social affairs","55":"Social affairs","56":"Social affairs","57":"North Korea","58":"Defense","59":"Social affairs","60":"Social affairs","61":"Foreign Policy","62":"Education","63":"Social affairs","64":"Politics","65":"Social affairs","66":"North Korea","67":"Social affairs","68":"Defense","69":"North Korea","70":"Social affairs","71":"North Korea","72":"Defense","73":"North Korea","74":"International","75":"Politics","76":"Politics","77":"Politics","78":"North Korea","79":"Social affairs","80":"North Korea","81":"Politics","82":"Politics","83":"Foreign Policy","84":"Politics","85":"Social affairs","86":"Social affairs","87":"Social affairs","88":"Politics","89":"Social affairs","90":"North Korea","91":"Politics","92":"Defense","93":"Foreign Policy","94":"Defense","95":"Social affairs","96":"Politics","97":"Social affairs","98":"Social affairs","99":"Diplomatic Circuit"}}
